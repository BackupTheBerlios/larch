Note that this doesn't build a pacman-type package, it is not designed
for installation on Arch systems, only for providing a runnable 'pacman'
on non-Arch systems.

I guess/hope the resulting package will run on x86_64 even if it is
built on i686, because all the libraries are included. The other way
round definitely won't work.
