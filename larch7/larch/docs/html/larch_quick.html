<h1><big>larch</big> &ndash; a do-it-yourself <em>live Arch Linux</em> system</h1>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<br /><br />

<p>The gui should make exploration of the possibilities offered by <em>larch</em>
quite straightforward. The documentation should provide enough information to
understand how a <em>larch live</em> system works, so that further customizations
can be performed beyond those directly supported.
</p>
<p>The general sequence of events starts with creating a 'project', which will
determine certain aspects of the build environment (such as where to place the
installation files), and select a profile. The profile describes the system to be
installed (primarily which packages, but also various other aspects). All this
configuration information is stored in the user's home directory (~/.config/larch),
so that it is retained from one <em>larch</em> run to the next.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>At present I only maintain a repository for 'i686',  as I don't run a 64-bit
   <em>Arch</em> machine, but as all the current <em>larch</em> packages 
   have architecture 'any', both architectures should be supported.
   </li>
   <li>Download the latest <em>larch</em> package from
   <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/larch/larch7/i686/"><strong>here</strong></a>
   and unpack it somewhere convenient. It can also be installed as a normal
   <em>Arch</em> package (you can put the <em>larch</em> repository in
   pacman.conf if you like).
   </li>
   <li>If you install it as a package it should be available via the desktop application
   list, or just by running 'larch' (after logging out and in, to update the search path).
   If you haven't installed it run the 'larch' script in the 'run' directory. There is,
   however, one small catch: <em>larch</em> must be run as root.
   If you are running as root (not generally recommended!), or you have
   <em>gksu</em> or <em>kdesu</em> installed, this should be no problem - the
   start script will manage these situations automatically.
   Otherwise you can start it from a terminal with <em>su</em> or <em>sudo</em>,
   </li>
   <li>To build a <em>larch live</em> system you basically just have to go through
   the first four pages one after the other.
   </li>
   <li>The first page allows you to create a project and select a profile. The 'mini'
   (no xorg) and 'xmini' (a fairly minimal xfce desktop) examples (from the supplied
   'profiles' folder) might be good places to start. The default installation path should
   be alright for most purposes, but you might need to move it if you don't have
   enough space on that partition. Be careful! If you put a silly path in here you might
   overwrite your system.
   </li>
   <li>The 'Installation' page performs the installation of the system to be squashed,
   by downloading and installing all the requested packages to the installation path
   set for the project. You can adjust a few aspects of this process, for example
   to use a local package mirror, or to add repositories to pacman.conf. The default
   is to use the mirror set on the host system and also to use the host's package
   cache, so that repeated builds don't need to download the packages all over
   again.
   </li>
   <li>The 'Larchify' page compresses the installation using squashfs, also building
   a squashed overlay containing all the customizations necessary for the
   <em>live</em> system and those specified in the profile.
   </li>
   <li>Finally the 'Medium' page writes the prepared <em>larch</em> files to an
   <em>iso</em> file (for CD or DVD), or to the partition of your choice (be careful!),
   so that you end up with a bootable <em>larch</em> system.
   </li>
   <li>Particular things that you might want to customize even in a first test run might
    be the supported <strong>locales</strong> and <strong>rc.conf</strong>.
    <li>Further details of the customization process are in the section
    <a href="larch_profiles.html">Profiles</a>.
   <li>  Share and Enjoy!</li>
