<h2>GUI Tab: Installation Tweaks</h2>

<p>At present the only thing offered here is a bit of assistance in
managing packages within the installation. The database can be
resynchronized, packages can be added or removed. During testing it can
be helpful to be able to make quick changes like this, but it is probably
not a good idea to use these facilities too freely. The installation will
differ from the specification in the profile (unless you immediately edit
the profile too), which may be no problem for one-offs, but if you ever
want to reuse the profile you may well lose track of what changes you have
made.
