Do I need a boot partition for ext4 root?
Should it be on offer (autopart) anyway?
Should I offer a larch-based boot partition (good for rescue/maintenance)?

Should I copy /.livesys/overlay and use a separate union mount for the
system-copy stage? At the cost of a little time and memory this would
reduce (not eliminate) potential problems with changes made during the
copying process.

Tweaks page?
------------

* Remove authorized keys from root account (esp. relevant with remote
  install).
* Regenerate system ssh keys (or just delete them so that at boot they
  will get regenerated).
* Tuning of fsck intervals (days and mounts).
* Storage Load Cycle Count problem ... daemon????

Other pages
-----------

* grub
* manual partitioning
* manual swaps??
* manual selection of mount-points, formatting, etc.
* ntfs shrinking


Maybe somehow in connection with the tweaks page?:
* timezone, time-setting
* add user(s?)
* locales
* keyboard???
