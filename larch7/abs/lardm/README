N.B. lardm was not playing well with hal 0.5.13-3, a normal user got no
access to at least the sound device. It worked with hal 0.5.13-2.
I guess this is a quite fundamental problem which I don't understand, having
something to do with the setting of access rights. With a later version
of hal it worked agin, so it might prove to be a bit unreliable ...

Each user must have a valid ~/.xinitrc file, otherwise no session can be
started. It could be as simple as:

exec xfce4-session

You can start lardm from the DAEMONS array in /etc/rc.conf:

DAEMONS=(syslog-ng @network dbus hal @lardm ...
