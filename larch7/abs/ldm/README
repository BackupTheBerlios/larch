N.B. ldm is not playing well with hal 0.5.13-3, a normal user gets no
access to at least the sound device. It worked with hal 0.5.13-2.

Each user must have a valid ~/.xinitrc file, otherwise no session can be
started. It could be as simple as:

exec xfce4-session

You can start ldm from the DAEMONS array in /etc/rc.conf:

DAEMONS=(syslog-ng @network dbus hal @ldm ...
