<h2>Set up the GRUB bootloader</h2>
<p>GRUB allows the booting of more than one operating system.
Normally it will be installed to the 'Master Boot Record' on the
first disk drive. Here it can be installed to the MBR of the drive
on which the '/boot' directory of the new installation is found - which
may be the root ('/') partition, or else a partition of its own (in which
case it will not contain a directory called '/boot')!
</p>
<p>Alternatively, GRUB may be installed to the partition containing the
'/boot' directory of the new installation (as above, either the root
partition or else, if the '/boot' directory has its own partition, the
partition mounted at '/boot').
</p>
<p>A further alternative is to boot the new Linux system from an existing
GRUB set-up by adding the entries for the new system to its menu.lst file.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to add the entries from an existing menu.lst to
those arising from the new installation, so that the operating systems
therein can still be booted, but from the newly installed bootloader.
</p>
<p>If an NTFS formatted partition is detected it will be added to the list
automatically.
</p>
<h3>WARNING</h3>
<p>If you have mixed IDE(PATA)/SCSI/SATA devices attached it is quite
possible that GRUB will get confused about their order. In other words you
might find that the association of GRUB names (hd0, hd1, etc.) to Linux
device names (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.) is incorrect. The result is
probably that you will not be able to boot your new system. In this case
you will have to manually edit menu.lst and put the correct number after
the 'hd' device entries.
