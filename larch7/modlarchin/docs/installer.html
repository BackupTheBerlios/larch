<h2>System Installation</h2>
<p>The chosen partitions will be formatted and mounted
and then the <em>live</em> system will be copied onto them.
After this has completed, all the <em>live</em> modifications are
removed/undone so that a normal <em>Arch Linux</em> system is left.
</p>
<p><em>larch(in)</em> also provides for further tweaks during the installation
process by means of the larch/copy/install-tweak file on the <em>live</em> medium,
which is run at the end of this stage. The contents of this file are
entirely left up to the creator of the <em>larch</em> profile.
</p>
<p>The individual steps are:
<ol>
  <li>Format installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Mount installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Copy system to installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Remove <em>live</em>-specific features.</li>
  <li>Perform custom installation tweaks (medium:larch/copy/install-tweak).</li>
  <li>Generate new initramfs.</li>
  <li>Generate /etc/fstab.</li>
  <li>Unmount installation partitions.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Device recognition via LABEL or UUID</h3>
<p>Because of the way block devices are detected in <em>Linux</em> it is
possible under certain circumstances for a partition to get assigned a
different name (e.g. /dev/sda can become /dev/sdb) from one boot to the
next. For this reason it is often sensible to address these devices in a
more stable way in grub and /etc/fstab.
</p>
<p>???The default in <em>larchin</em> is to use the device LABEL, if there
is one, otherwise the UUID. Only if the checkbox 'Use device name' is
checked will the device name (/dev/sda1, etc.) be used.
</p>

<h3>Customizing Formatting</h3>
<p>To allow tweaking of the way partitions are formatted, the syscall
script 'part-format' sources a script in the sub-directory 'tweaks' with
    a name built from the file-system type, 'tweaks/format-<em>fstype</em>'.
    If you want to make use of this feature, see the 'part-format' script.
