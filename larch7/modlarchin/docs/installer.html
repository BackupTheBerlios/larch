<h2>System Installation</h2>
<p>The chosen partitions will be formatted and mounted
and then the <em>live</em> system will be copied onto them.
After this has completed, all the <em>live</em> modifications are
removed/undone so that a normal <em>Arch Linux</em> system is left.
</p>
<p>The volume label or uuid of the installation partition(s) may be
optionally set, by passing the appropriate values.
</p>
<p><em>larch(in)</em> also provides for further tweaks during the installation
process by means of the larch/copy/delarch file on the <em>live</em> medium,
which is run at the end of this stage. The contents of this file are
entirely left up to the creator of the <em>larch</em> profile.
</p>
<p>The individual steps are:
<ol>
  <li>Format installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Mount installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Copy system to installation partitions.</li>
  <li>Remove <em>live</em>-specific features.</li>
  <li>Perform custom installation tweaks (medium:larch/copy/delarch).</li>
  <li>Generate new initramfs.</li>
  <li>Generate /etc/fstab.</li>
  <li>Unmount installation partitions.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Device recognition via LABEL or UUID</h3>
<p>Because of the way block devices are detected in <em>Linux</em> it is
possible under certain circumstances for a partition to get assigned a
different name (e.g. /dev/sda can become /dev/sdb) from one boot to the
next. For this reason it is often sensible to address these devices in a
more stable way in grub and /etc/fstab, either via volume label or UUID.
</p>
<p>When a partition is formatted, it will generally receive a new UUID.
It's label will be unchanged. It is possible to change the label, by
passing an appropriate value as the fourth item in a partition-descriptor,
e.g.
<pre>
	'/:dev/sda2:ext4:LABEL=ArchRoot'
</pre>
Alternatively (though probably rarely useful) the UUID can be set to a
known value pay passing this instead of the label argument, e.g.
<pre>
	'/:dev/sda2:ext4:UUID=e548c2e4-bb47-4fc3-9496-a8c7affd4b82'
</pre>
If neither of these two values are passed the default behaviour (label
unchanged, new UUID) will result.
</p>
<p>The default in <em>larchin</em> is for /etc/fstab and grub to use the
device LABEL, if there is one, otherwise the UUID. By setting the fourth
item in the root-partition-descriptor to '-', it is possible to specify
that the device name (e.g. /dev/sda2) should be used for addreesing the
partition.
</p>

<h3>Customizing Formatting</h3>
<p>To allow tweaking of the way partitions are formatted, the syscall
script 'part-format' sources a script in the sub-directory 'tweaks' with
    a name built from the file-system type, 'tweaks/format-<em>fstype</em>'.
    If you want to make use of this feature, see the 'part-format' script.
